# Kimbrough-mEosNb

This repository contains the code required to reproduce the figures in *Kimbrough et al, 2025* (proper citation to be added upon publication).

The exact fcs files used for plots are available in `data/`. These fcs files were exported from FCS Express 7 after gating and color compensation. The original fcs files are available (or will soon be available) at [https://www.stowers.org/research/publications/LIBPB-2520](https://www.stowers.org/research/publications/LIBPB-2520).

The full contents of the conda environment I used can be seen in `conda_environment.yaml`. It includes many more packages than are actually required for the analysis here.
